comment: "A follow-up appointment is a subsequent meeting after an initial consultation or session. It allows professionals and individuals to review progress, address any concerns, and adjust plans or treatments as necessary. These appointments are essential for ensuring continuity of care, monitoring outcomes, and reinforcing the steps or actions discussed during the first meeting. They often serve as checkpoints to gauge effectiveness and make informed decisions moving forward."
