description:
  TestScript example resource showing use of origin and destination for
  multisystem support. The single origin will execute a Patient read against the two
  destination systems using user defined dynamic variables. The test engine will wait
  at each operation action with a defined origin and destination for the origin test
  system to send the expected FHIR operation to the destination test system. Once
  the expected request and response is observed, the test engine will continue with
  the test execution.
